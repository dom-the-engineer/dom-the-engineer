Hello! I'm Dominic. Welcome to my Github Profile. I'm currently a Site Reliability Engineer in the Australian Banking Sector.

Outside of work, I like to tinker around with my own code and stay fresh with new tech.

Outside of tech, I love to go on runs, play golf and read. My favourite book is Atomic Habits, by James Clear.

If you'd like to chat, let's connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dom-guo/)!
